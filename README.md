## 🙋🏻‍♂️ Introducing Myself 

Hi all 👋, I'm Cris, I'm an aspiring Electrical Engineer who is passionate about solving meaningful problems and eager to contribute to a team of excelling individuals. I am also a data enthusiast with a strong focus in machine learning and data analysis. I have a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. 

Currently, I'm open to entry-level opportunities in roles such as Electrical Engineer, Software Engineer, and Data Analyst.

### 📚 Projects

Welcome to my coding portfolio, where I showcase my projects that involve programming in some way. They're my repositories...

I specially liked my [Simple Calculator](), it was harder to make than it seems. Hope you check it out.


### 🛠️ Tools

- Database: Google BigQuery
- Programing Languages: Proficient in Python, Dart, and SQL. Proficiency in C, MATLAB, and R.
- Business Intelligence: Tableau
- Additinal: MS Office Suite and Google Suite.


### 🤷‍♂ What I've Been Up To?
- 🌱 I exercised some data analysis muscles by taking on a Case Study (courtesy of Coursera) as a capstone project for my Google Data Analytics course. Check it out at [My Case Studies](https://csarevalo.github.io/Case-Studies/). FYI, it's an in-depth review of my data analysis process so consider just checking out the summary or tableau dashboard if you are short on time. Short Overview: I deep dive into how cyclists behavior in a bikeshare program can differ and develop business decisions to convert customers into members, racking in more profit.
- 💞️ I’m currently working on building a web portfolio to showcase my projects well, ... I'll post the link here when I'm done
- 📫 How to reach me? You can reach me through my email (csarevalo1@gmail.com) and through my mobile number (+1-323-215-9581).
